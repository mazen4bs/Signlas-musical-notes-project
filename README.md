# Signlas-musical-notes-project
In this project musical notes are defined by there equations and frequencies and then the following requirment was done on them 
-Generate four signals x1, x2, x3 and x4 which correspond to the four musical
notes DO, RE, MI and FA.
-Create a signal xptq which corresponds to sequentially playing the musical notes (DO,
RE, MI, FA) which you have created in the previous step. Store the generated signal x(t) as
an audio file with extension(*.wav)
-Plot the signal xptq versus time t.
-Compute the energy of the signal x(t).
-Compute the frequency spectrum x(f) of this signal.
-Plot the magnitude of X(f) in the frequency range -fs/2 <= f <=fs/2, where fs is the
sampling frequency.
-Compute the Energy of the signal x(t) from its frequency spectrum X(f), and hence you
can verify Parseval’s theorem
-Design a Butterworth low-pass filter with filter order 20 such that when the signal x(t)
is applied to this filter, the output does NOT contain the MI and FA musical nodes. What is
the cut-off frequency of this filter
- Plot the magnitude and phase response of the Butterworth LPF you’ve designed
-Apply the signal xptq to this Butterworth LPF and let’s denote the output signal as y1(t)
- Store the generated signal y1ptq as an audio file with extension (*.wav)
- Plot the signal y1(t) versus time t.
- Compute the energy of the signal y1ptq.
-Compute the frequency spectrum Y1pfq of this signal.
- Plot the magnitude of Y1pfq in the frequency range ´fs{2 ď f ď fs{2.
-Compute the Energy of the signal y1ptq from its frequency spectrum Y1(f), and hence
you can verify Parseval’s theorem.
- Design a Butterworth high-pass filter with filter order 20 such that when the signal xptq
is applied to this filter, the output does NOT contain the DO and RE musical nodes. 
-Plot the magnitude and phase response of the Butterworth HPF you’ve designed.
-Apply the signal xptq to this Butterworth HPF and let’s denote the output signal as y2ptq.
-Store the generated signal y2ptq as an audio file with extension (*.wav)
-Plot the signal y2ptq versus time t.
-Compute the energy of the signal y2ptq.
- Compute the frequency spectrum Y2pfq of this signal.
-Plot the magnitude of Y2pfq in the frequency range ´fs{2 ď f ď fs{2.
-Compute the Energy of the signal y2ptq from its frequency spectrum Y2pfq, and hence
you can verify Parseval’s theorem.
